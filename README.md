## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. 👨‍🎓 Intelligent Student Portal
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Live countdown of the 3-day clearance window, status badges, and prioritized tasks.
- **Unified Clearance Request**: A single-click application that triggers the entire institutional workflow.
- **Digital Clearance Certificate**: Automatically generated upon Registrar approval, featuring a secure "Final Seal."
- **Profile Management**: Dynamic photo uploading and real-time email domain verification to prevent fake accounts.

### 2. 🛡️ Administrative Ecosystem
- **Sequential Chain of Responsibility**: Approvals flow logically from **Library → Cafeteria → Dormitory → Department Head → Registrar**.
- **Adaptive Locking Logic**: A groundbreaking security feature that allows admins to undo decisions *only* if the next department in the chain hasn't yet acted.
- **Bulk Processing Engine**: Handle hundreds of clearance requests simultaneously with automated conflict resolution.
- **Audit Logs**: Enhanced traceability including **student names**, admin IDs, IP addresses, and detailed action timestamps.
- **Special Clearance Management**: Dedicated module for handling withdrawals, transfers, and disciplinary exceptions.

### 3. 📧 Advanced Communication
- **Context-Aware Emails**: Custom-styled HTML email templates for Approval/Rejection/Recovery.
- **Production-Ready Links**: Automated link generation pointing to the live Render deployment (`https://dbu-clearance-system.onrender.com`).

## 🔄 The Modular Workflow

### 🌊 Sequential Approval Chain
The system enforces a strict business logic to ensure no property is left unreturned:
1.  **Library**: Clears books, digital resources, and library cards.
2.  **Cafeteria**: Verifies no outstanding mess fees or returned utensils.
3.  **Dormitory**: Confirms room keys and furniture are in original condition.
4.  **Department Head**: Final academic check for grades and departmental equipment.
5.  **Registrar (Final Seal)**: The ultimate authority. Approving here generates the certificate and marks the student as "Inactive."

### 🔒 Security & Integrity
- **Route Guards**: Middleware-based protection.
- **Session Persistence**: Secure PostgreSQL-backed sessions (via `connect-pg-simple`) for reliable admin login.
- **Hashed Secrets**: All sensitive data is encrypted using salt-rounds performance-optimized Bcrypt.

## ☁️ Deployment Guide (Render + Neon)

This guide shows you how to deploy this full-stack PERN application (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node) for free using **Neon** (Database) and **Render** (Web Service).

### Step 1: Set up the Database (Neon)
1. Go to [Neon.tech](https://neon.tech) and create a free project.
2. Copy the **Connection String** provided by Neon (e.g., `postgres://user:pass@host/db...`).

### Step 2: Deploy to Render
1. Go to [Render.com](https://render.com), create a **Web Service**, and connect your GitHub repo.
2. Settings:
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Start Command**: `npm start`
3. **Environment Variables**: Add these in the Render dashboard:
   - `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`: Use values from Neon.
   - `PGSSLMODE`: `require` (Crucial for Neon connection).
   - `NODE_ENV`: `production`
   - `EMAIL_USER` & `EMAIL_PASS`: Your Gmail credentials.

### Step 3: Run Database Migration
Once deployed, go to the **Shell** tab in Render and run:
```bash
node setup_pg.js
```
This initializes the database tables in your live Neon instance.
